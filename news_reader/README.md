# AI News Agent & Summarizer

This project is a fully automated, database-backed news agent. It monitors predefined RSS feeds (specifically for Israeli news), incrementally scrapes new articles throughout the day, avoids duplicates using a cloud database, and generates a concise, AI-powered daily digest delivered via email.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Incremental Scraping:** Runs multiple times a day (morning, noon, afternoon) to spread the workload and capture breaking news.
* **Transactional Integrity:** Implements a "Safe Commit" system. Articles are only marked as "Processed" in the database *after* they have been successfully summarized. If the AI fails, the articles remain pending and are retried automatically on the next run.
* **Smart Deduplication:** Uses **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** to track every processed URL, ensuring no article is summarized twice.
* **Robust AI Integration:** Powered by **OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini** for high-quality, factual, and cost-effective summarization ($0.15/1M tokens).
* **Stealth Scraping:** Uses `Playwright` with stealth plugins to bypass bot detection on news sites.
* **Automated Reporting:** Aggregates all daily summaries into a clean, mobile-friendly HTML report and emails it every evening.
* **Zero-Maintenance:** Hosted entirely on **GitHub Actions** with scheduled workflows.

## 🧠 Algorithm & Workflow Logic

The bot operates in two distinct modes: **Accumulation** and **Reporting**.

### Phase 1: The Accumulation Algorithm (Runs 3x Daily)
*Goal: detailed processing of new articles with fail-safe logic.*

1.  **Initialize & Config:**
    * Load RSS feed URLs from `config.toml`.
    * Connect to Supabase DB and OpenAI using secrets.

2.  **Feed Parsing & Filtering:**
    * Fetch the latest XML data from all configured RSS feeds.
    * **Deduplication Check:** Query the `processed_articles` DB table for every link.
    * **Result:** A list of *only* new, unseen articles.

3.  **Content Extraction:**
    * Launch a headless Chromium browser (Playwright) with stealth headers.
    * Scrape the full text of valid articles.
    * **Output:** A structured dictionary of feed data (Links + Text), *without* saving to the DB yet.

4.  **Transactional Summarization (The Critical Step):**
    * The system takes the batch of new texts for a specific feed.
    * **Action:** Sends the text to **GPT-4o-mini** for summarization.
    * **Verification:**
        * ❌ **If AI Fails:** The process stops for this feed. Exceptions are logged. The articles are **NOT** marked as processed. They will be picked up again in the next run.
        * ✅ **If AI Succeeds:**
            1.  Save the generated summary to the `daily_summaries` table.
            2.  **COMMIT:** Iterate through the source URLs and insert them into the `processed_articles` table.

### Phase 2: The Reporting Algorithm (Runs 1x Evening)
*Goal: Synthesis and delivery of the daily digest.*

1.  **Data Retrieval:**
    * Query table `daily_summaries` in Supabase.
    * Select ALL summaries where `run_date` matches **Today**.

2.  **Master Synthesis:**
    * Concatenate all individual summaries into one large text block.
    * Send this block to **GPT-4o-mini** with a "newsletter generation" prompt.
    * The AI organizes the news by topic, removes redundancy, and formats it as Markdown.

3.  **Formatting & Delivery:**
    * Convert the AI Markdown output into a styled HTML email template.
    * Connect to Gmail SMTP server.
    * Send the email to the subscriber list.
